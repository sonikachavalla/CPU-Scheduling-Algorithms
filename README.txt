CPU Scheduling Algorithms

This project consists of various CPU scheduling algorithms which helps us to get the reading or metrics for each and every algorithm for a particular scheduling file that has few tasks which are processes that run in CPU in real-time scenario. This will help us to know which algorithm is best suited for the CPU to use to run the tasks that will help to increase the performance of the CPU.

The project has 6 files-
FCFS.java
SJF.java
PriorityScheduling.java
RoundRobin.java
PriorityRoundRobin.java
schedule.txt (the file that have the test case that has to be performed on the algorithm files)

Open the command prompt and go to the path in which the java files exist.(Make sure you have java software installed in the system.)
To compile the files use- 'javac Filename.java'
To run these files use- 'java Filename schedule.txt'

By running all the test cases we can draw the conclusion on which algorithm is efficient for CPU scheduling.
